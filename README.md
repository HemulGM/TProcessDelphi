# TProcess-Delphi
TProcess for Delphi, ported from Freepascal

TProcess allows one to capture the output from another executable in a cross platform way.

Many developers have complained that there is no equivalent in Delphi, so why not port it? That's what this project intends to do.

Initial port done for MS Windows.
More work done on this soon: get it working in Firemonkey, MacOS port  (so long as FireMonkey has the needed Macos/Unix functions in the RTL which fpc used)
