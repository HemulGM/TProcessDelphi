# TProcess-Delphi
TProcess for Delphi, ported from Freepascal

## About TProcess
TProcess allows one to capture the output from an executable in a cross platform way without using low level API calls and pipes (this is a wrapper around them).

Many developers have complained that there is no equivalent in Delphi which freepascal already has, so why not port it? That's what this project intends to do.

Initial port done for MS Windows.
More work done on this soon: get it working in Firemonkey, macOS port  (so long as FireMonkey has the needed Macos/Unix functions in the RTL which fpc used)
